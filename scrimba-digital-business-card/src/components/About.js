      <p>
        As an aspiring front-end web developer, I completed a 3-month intensive bootcamp with Le Wagon in London,
        where I gained a strong foundation in web development fundamentals, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby.
        During the course, I discovered a passion for the creative and interactive side of web development,
        which has led me to focus on front-end web development.
